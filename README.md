# Build a web app in JavaScript :
In this project, i will finalize the previous project 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap and make some parts dynamic with Javascript (JQuery exactly).

I will reuse final files of 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap and update them.

I will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap/Javascript knowledges that i learned previously.

I wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, i'm free to implement it the way that i want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

Here the final result:
